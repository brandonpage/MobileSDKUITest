#  Mobile SDK UI Tests for Android

These tests are designed to validate the functionality of Android apps created using the MobileSDK CLI tools.  Unless otherwise specified each test should run against apps generated using native Java/Kotlin, Cordova, or React Native code.

Basic usage:
1.  Build the app(s) to be tested on a specific device.
2.  Run the tests here agianst the same device and supply the test app's package id as a parameter with the `-e` flag and the key `packageName`.

ex:  `adb shell am instrument -w -r -e debug false -e packageName com.mycompany com.salesforce.mobilesdk.mobilesdkuitest.test/android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner`

For Development purposes tests can be run in Android Studio by hardcoding the `packageName` variable in `TestApplication.kt` and running against a device that has the app associated with that package name installed.
